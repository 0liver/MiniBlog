### Why another blog engine?
7 years have past since I started the BlogEngine.NET project. 
It was using cutting edge technology for its time and quickly became the 
most popular blogging platform using ASP.NET.

The MiniBlog was born as a test to see what a modern blog engine could
look like today with the latest ASP.NET and HTML 5 technologies. Just like
with BlogEngine.NET, the goal was to see how small and simple such a 
blog engine could be. 

This is the result.
