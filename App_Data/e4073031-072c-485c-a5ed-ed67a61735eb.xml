  <title>Web Developer Checklist</title>
  <description />
  <content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://madskristensen.net/image.axd?picture=image_59.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;So you just built a website and are about to make it public to the world. You go through a few checks to make sure that everything works as expected. Perhaps run HTML validation and other similar services. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But are you sure you remembered to implement all the best practices? Does it look good on mobile devices, in Windows 8 snapped view and what about basic accessibility?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Enter &lt;a href="http://webdevchecklist.com/"&gt;Web Developer Checklist&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We’ve tried to come up with the complete list of tasks and checks that every web developer should go through when developing any kind of website. The &lt;a href="http://webdevchecklist.com/"&gt;Web Developer Checklist&lt;/a&gt; is structured in a way that makes it really easy to follow the progress as well as getting help to perform all the checks.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Give it a try and let me know what you think.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

      <content>Nice concept.

A problem though: the information icons don&amp;#39;t expand when using Firefox 17.0.1, especially the one attached to the &amp;quot;Check website in all browsers&amp;quot; option :-D

      <content>Haha, how&amp;#39;s that for irony :)

It works well in Firefox 17.0.1 on my machine. Strange...</content>

      <content>Nice idea, but still needs work. For starters:

I don&amp;#39;t see the info icons at all on original iPad (3 browsers tried) so I have no idea what &amp;quot;world ready&amp;quot; is.
Rather than no www, I&amp;#39;d say make sure it works with and without www and one version 301s to the other. Lots of people will type www even if you say not to.
&amp;quot;Security best practices&amp;quot; is too vague. Obviously there could be hundreds but maybe refer to OWASP top 10?
Not sure why you specify microdata when you don&amp;#39;t mention specific tech elsewhere. RDFa is just as good, arguably better.
I don&amp;#39;t think it should have WAI-ARIA as optional. I&amp;#39;d put &amp;quot;test in NVDA&amp;quot; instead. If there are problems WAI-ARIA may be the solution, but you need it or you don&amp;#39;t - it&amp;#39;s not a preference.

By the way your comment form isn&amp;#39;t working in the mobile theme.</content>

      <content>I don&amp;#39;t see OpenGraph along with microdata. IE10 shares rich content if you support OpenGraph:
